		For this game, our team was given the prompt <q>Some dudebros pull a prank that goes horribly wrong.</q> The game stars six college fraternity brothers who soap a fountain, accidentally flooding their entire campus. They must escape the flood of suds on a floating matress, collecting party supplies along the way.

		My notable contributions:
		<ul>
			<li>Procedurally generated scrolling background.</li>
			<li>A system for randomly spawning obstacles and/or collectibles ahead of the player. The system ended up being used for the grand majority of level design.</li>
			<li>An unconventional health display, in the form of the number of people on the raft. Taking damage causes bros to fall off. Certain animations will only play if enough bros are present.</li>
			<li>Robust player tinting/flashing system.</li>
			<li>All voice acting (for my sins).</li>
		</ul>
