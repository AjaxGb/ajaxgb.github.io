		<h1>HTML5 Video Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>
		<time>2016 &ndash; present</time>

		<p>
		A Chrome plugin that adds keyboard controls and shortcuts to Chrome's built-in video player. At time of writing the plugin has over 5,000 users and an average 4.25 star rating.

		In March 2016, I finally got fed up with Chrome's built in HTML5 video player. While basically functional, it had no keyboard controls at all, which made things like skipping ahead or back tedious at best, and challenging at worst.
		</p>
		<p>
		I decided to write a simple Chrome plugin that added the shortcuts I wanted, mostly drawn from Google's own YouTube player. After I'd finished that, it seemed simple enough to polish it up and release it publicly. It wasn't as simple as I'd initially planned, but I'm very satisfied with the results.

		<em>According to the rules of the contest, the game only had to run on the <strong>latest version of Chrome</strong>. It is <strong>not</strong> guaranteed to run on any other browser.</em> The contest website contains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McwworxULg0">a YouTube video</a> showing gameplay.
		</p>
		<p>
		The game features two competing teams of frogs, as well as a computer-controlled team of bugs that can be eaten to regain health. It is played using the left mouse button to drag the camera and to select units, and the right mouse button to direct them.
		</p>
		<p>
		Unfortunately, due to a mix-up on my part regarding the deadline's time zone my submission could not be considered for the final ranking. I still enjoyed the time I spent on it and appreciate the techniques I learned.

		For this game, our team was given the prompt <q>Some dudebros pull a prank that goes horribly wrong.</q> The game stars six college fraternity brothers who soap a fountain, accidentally flooding their entire campus. They must escape the flood of suds on a floating matress, collecting party supplies along the way.
		</p>
		<p>
		My notable contributions:
		<ul>
			<li>Procedurally generated scrolling background.</li>
			<li>A system for randomly spawning obstacles and/or collectibles ahead of the player. The system ended up being used for the grand majority of level design.</li>
			<li>An unconventional health display, in the form of the number of people on the raft. Taking damage causes bros to fall off. Certain animations will only play if enough bros are present.</li>
			<li>Robust player tinting/flashing system.</li>
			<li>All voice acting (for my sins).</li>
		</ul>
